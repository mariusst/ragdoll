- documents: PDFs, docx, html, excel, images, plain text
- each document type has its own parser
- parsers returns features (eg. title, author, date, paragraphs, entities)
- prompt is first turned into database queries
- data is ranked by relevance
- LLM is left to respond to initial query using the context it gained through the queries
